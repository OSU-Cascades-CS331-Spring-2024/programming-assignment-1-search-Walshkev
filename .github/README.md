obviously these are not perfect i would expect the BFS and DLS to have a larger frontier than A Star and UCS
from the way i codded it i think the space complexity for BFS to be the highest since it has to explore more nodes before it finds the goal 
UCS and A STAR would have the best space complexity since it is expanding in an optimized  way. 
i think A star has a slight advantage when it comes to space and time complexity compared to UCS but it is not always give the most optimized answer
i am not happy with the work i did on this assignment but unfortunately i ran out of time to optimize the main file and make sure the numbers i was 
generating in the future i will try and get to this point by monday so i can get important feed back during office hours
